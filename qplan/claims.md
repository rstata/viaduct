# Claims

**[flattened-equivalence]** Within qplan's post-validation field-resolution boundary, flattened selections preserve the same unordered field-resolution obligations as nested GraphQL selections.

**[field-only-node-lowering]** Within the fixture-supported node domain, a retained source GraphQL-Java schema plus a separate model-only schema with `foo_V_A_node` producers, concrete `T_V_A_Bridge` objects, and `node` loaders preserves the field-resolution obligations of external node-valued field and node-resolver inputs.

**[resolver03-one-shot-construction]** Within Resolver03's acyclic domain with argument-defined variables, every resolver-bearing OER occurrence is constructed by one field-resolver application after all guarded transitive demand for that occurrence has been aggregated.

**[resolver02-demand-closed-result]** Within Resolver02's finite acyclic domain with only `FromArgument` variables, resolving a Query selection forest produces an `ObjectEngineResult` closed under every activated resolver's fixed input demand.

**[resolver-provider-containment-construction]** Pre-reasoning construction of every canonical Kotlin registry built by `TestWorld` contains each field-relative variable provider path in its defining resolver's fixed object fragment.

**[resolver-local-construction-proof]** Under the finite exact-key world assumptions in `tla/ResolverCore.tla`, TLAPS proves that least demand closure followed by a valid dependency-first fold terminates, supplies every exact direct resolver input first, and gives each activated resolver key one unique application position per concrete OER occurrence.

**[dependency-order-worklist-proof]** Under the finite acyclic dependency assumption in `tla/DependencyOrder.tla`, TLAPS proves that the shared dependency-order worklist terminates, resolves every key only after its dependencies, and never reapplies a resolved key.

**[resolver03-guarded-producer-completeness-proof]** Under the exact registry-extension assumption in `tla/Resolver03.tla`, TLAPS proves that each activated nested resolver occurrence's guarded transitive requirement tokens are included in its owning producer's supplied demand before that producer's unique application.

**[resolver03-composed-application-proof]** Under the finite extensional result-tree, deterministic materialization, observation-alignment, and exact registry-extension assumptions in `tla/Resolver03Application.tla`, TLAPS proves that the occurrence product fold terminates in a Resolver03 result satisfying every modeled `correctResolution` conjunct.

**[resolver-result-tree-refinement-proof]** Under the finite extensional carrier and observation-alignment assumptions in `tla/ResultTree.tla` through `tla/ValueConstruction.tla`, TLAPS proves that Resolver01 and Resolver02 construction postconditions imply every conjunct of the modeled `correctResolution` judgment.

**[resolver-occurrence-product-fold-proof]** Under finite dependency-first construction orders for every reachable OER object occurrence, TLAPS proves that their interleaved product fold terminates with every occurrence's built keys equal to its least closed demand.
