# Model Design Guidelines

## Scope

These are the canonical concrete design and implementation rules for public semantic model types and semantic model logic.

For example, `EngineResult`, `Arguments`, and `Selection` are semantic model types because reasoning is defined over their values. An exception class, a dependency-injection qualifier, or `TestWorld` is not a semantic model type merely because it occurs in the same Gradle project.

Exceptions, annotations, dependency-injection qualifiers, test utilities, parsing, schema decoding, registry assembly, and other composition infrastructure are outside these policies unless a rule explicitly includes them.

## Carrier Boundary

The carrier model treats `EngineInputData`, `EngineOutputData`, and `EngineResult` as distinct checked semantic unions represented by Kotlin `Any` typealiases. Their members are defined by domain-specific conformance relations rather than Kotlin subtyping. Nullable uses add GraphQL null. The aliases cannot distinguish overloads or prevent arbitrary `Any` values from crossing unchecked programming boundaries, so construction, publication, conversion, and observation operations enforce the appropriate domain relation.

Union equality is classified independently from representation. A homogeneous union gives every member the same equality semantics; a heterogeneous union admits members with different equality semantics. Only a homogeneous value-equality union has useful equality at the union level, with recursive structural equality of immutable composites treated as value equality. Equality-dependent operations on a heterogeneous union are undefined until the operation narrows its operands to a homogeneous subset and applies that subset's documented relation. `EngineInputData` is homogeneous value-equality. `EngineOutputData` and `EngineResult` are heterogeneous.

`EngineResult` values are finite graphs. Their structural containment edges, obtained by excluding `ObjectEngineResult.ParentKey` cells, are well-founded; a parent cell is the sole distinguished backedge and references the immediate structural ancestor OER. Pre-domain scalar values use structural equality, cells and OERs use reference equality, and lists use structural equality over their type expression and positional cell identity. Use `sameCompletedResultAs` for explicit extensional comparison of completed result graphs.

Mutable OERs may gain validated exact cells monotonically. Each cell has independent write-once value and access-result promises, and a written child cell may retain a mutable descendant OER while that descendant gains cells. Arbitrary cycles and self-reference are outside the result domain; validated child-to-parent backedges are admitted. Structural algorithms skip those edges, while finite selection-driven materialization follows them. Result union is currently undefined for graphs containing parent backedges because a correct union would have to retarget copied backedges to copied ancestors.

`ViaductSchema` and `ResolverRegistry` are externally supplied canonical worlds. Test-fixture composition lowers the retained source schema, canonicalizes variables, validates provider paths, and assembles registries; semantic code receives only the canonical lowered schema and model-owned `FieldResolver` values.

Use canonical schema definitions and `ViaductSchema.CompositeTypeDef.possibleObjectTypes` for field ownership and concrete applicability rather than Kotlin inheritance. Source-facing fixture infrastructure delegates nominal relation, overlap, and fragment-spread reasoning to the shared `GraphQLTypeRelations` built from the retained source `GraphQLSchema`; lowered-world reasoning uses the canonical `ViaductSchema`.

Each source-backed canonical `ViaductSchema.Object` retains the exact GraphQL-Java definition from the unchanged source schema. Synthetic bridge objects retain generated definitions only for internal EODs. These attachments are not part of the mathematical model: reasoning must not inspect them for equality, hashing, conformance, field ownership, applicability, or subtype decisions.

## Variables And Keys

A resolver occurrence is identified by the reference identity of its Query-rooted OER and its exact structural path within that result graph. The primary operation result is the root for its resolver occurrences; every independently executed query fragment creates a fresh Query OER that roots the resolver occurrences within that fragment. A variable template is identified by its local name and defining concrete resolver field. Its `instanceId` is null. Instantiating it for an exact `ResolverOccurrenceId` creates an occurrence-specific variable carrying a `VariableInstanceId`. Every use of one variable within that resolver occurrence has the same identity, including uses in different selections or descendant OERs. Request-local `Assumptions` stores one declared promise per variable-instance ID: synchronous semantic operations read completed bindings, while coroutine operations may suspend for them.

Registry assembly compiles `FromArgument` declarations to canonical input paths rooted at a resolver argument and compiles `FromObjectField` and `FromQueryField` declarations to contained canonical object-key paths in their respective fragments. Argument paths may traverse input objects, short-circuit to null at a null intermediate, and never traverse a list. Registry assembly validates one acyclic provider/use order across both from-field variants before reasoning. Every maintained resolver evaluates `FromArgument`; Resolver26 additionally evaluates `FromObjectField` and `FromQueryField` at runtime.

### Parent-variable restriction

A resolver input may not use a variable on any concrete branch reachable beneath an `@parent` selection. Because every resolver variable is owned by its defining resolver occurrence, such a use would send occurrence-specific demand from a descendant back to the targeted ancestor. Literal arguments on fields selected beneath `@parent` remain valid. Separately, the current parent relation requires both the parent field and its paired child producer to be argumentless.

The narrower implementation requirement would prohibit a descendant-owned variable only when reaching the targeted ancestor crosses a list-valued child-producer edge. A singular child occurrence has a statically identifiable path, so its symbolic ancestor key could be reserved before its value is available. A list producer's cardinality and element indices do not exist until the producer returns, and each resulting child occurrence may bind the variable differently. One-shot demand closure therefore cannot reserve all of those distinct ancestor keys in advance.

Qplan deliberately applies the stronger rule to every parent traversal. Tenants do not need to inspect every edge in a multi-level parent chain to determine whether an argument is valid, and qplan can relax the rule backward-compatibly if real use cases justify more dynamic planning. Beginning with the narrower rule and later tightening it would instead invalidate registries that had already been accepted.

`ObjectEngineResult.Key` is an open selection key. `ObjectEngineResult.ObjectKey` refines it to a concrete object field while retaining symbolic arguments and is admitted to OER cells and exact paths. `ObjectEngineResult.GroundKey` additionally requires resolved arguments and remains the checked boundary for materialization operations, dependency ordering, and resolver invocation that need concrete input values.

`ObjectEngineResult.Key` equality is structural over its field and arguments. A symbolic key's recursively contained variables carry their resolver-occurrence identity, so equal uses of the same variable instance coalesce while uses of different variable instances remain distinct. Keys do not carry a separate occurrence discriminator. Completing variable bindings never changes key equality or requires rekeying an OER cell.

Keys belong exclusively to the engine-result domain. `EngineObjectData.Sync` uses string selections. Passive source and resolver-produced objects use canonical argumentless field names. Resolver inputs materialized from object fragments use GraphQL response keys, including aliases. Those response keys select entries in the resolver-visible value only; symbolic or grounded OER keys address cells independently of aliases.

`EngineObjectDataEntry` carries a string selection, canonical object field, and value only through object construction so the factory can validate schema conformance before retaining the string map. A completed EOD does not retain hidden OER keys or schema-field metadata. Argument-bearing passive fields are outside the source and resolver-output domain and must be rejected.

`Arguments` is the broad argument-tuple category. `Arguments.Resolved` contains canonical `EngineInputData`, `Arguments.Error` is the tuple-level argument-resolution error, and `Arguments.Template` retains resolver-registry variable templates. Recursive argument expressions are an internal natural union of engine input data, ordinary lists and input-object maps, `Arguments.Variable`, and `ArgumentResolutionError`; there is no public open-value wrapper. Engine input data has no error sentinel, and variable bindings likewise distinguish error-free engine input data from an error outcome. Grounding throws on an unbound variable instance or an uninstantiated template.

## Result Representation

The `EngineResult` domain admits Kotlin `Int`, finite `Double`, `Boolean`, and `String`, structural `EngineIDResult`, canonical `ViaductSchema.EnumValue`, `ObjectEngineResult`, `ListEngineResult`, and `ErrorEngineResult`. These are semantic union members rather than implementations of a common nominal result interface.

Every object-field and list-element value slot contains `EngineResult?`. Null represents GraphQL null. Every non-null child is another member of the result domain. Schema conformance admits `ErrorEngineResult` at every output type expression, including non-null types, so an error may occupy any value location in a result graph. `ErrorEngineResult` is an inhabited reference-equal error variant rather than Kotlin's bottom type and exposes no simple, object, or list properties. `ErrorEngineResult.of(errorData)` retains the exact metadata-bearing `EngineErrorData` represented at that result location so conversion back to resolver-visible output returns the same carrier without discarding error information.

`EngineResultCell` represents one object-field or list-element occurrence with independent value and access-result promises. Its value promise contains `EngineResult?` and obeys the corresponding field or element schema type. Its non-null access-result promise contains `EngineResult` constrained to either `Boolean` or `ErrorEngineResult`; true means accepted, false means rejected, and an error result means access evaluation failed. This is an independent conformance relation rather than a GraphQL field-type relation. Factories, direct setters, and deferred promises validate their respective slot relation before making a completion observable.

`ListEngineResult` remains a nominal typed result wrapper and implements `List<EngineResultCell>` by delegation to a private backing list. The wrapper carries the element `typeExpr`; its equality is structural over that type expression and positional cell identities. A builder may transfer a mutable list into the wrapper without copying only when ownership transfer is exclusive and the builder retains no post-publication mutation path. The read-only `List` interface and a private delegate do not by themselves make an aliased mutable list immutable.

`EngineOutputData` represents resolver output without result cells or access decisions. Its members are production-compatible scalar representations, recursive `List<EngineOutputData?>`, `EngineObjectData.Sync`, and `EngineErrorData`. Every object-valued member is therefore an `EngineObjectData.Sync`; an ordinary map is not object output. `EngineErrorData` belongs to the broad output domain but not to narrower simple, list, or object categories. It is a reference-equal error carrier, not semantically a singleton. `EngineErrorData.of()` creates an error without causal metadata, while `EngineErrorData.of(Throwable)` retains the exact executor failure and its existing attribution chain. A derived resolver failure chains that cause through the temporary Engine API read exception rather than discarding it. Do not collapse resolver output and engine result into one carrier merely because they contain corresponding successful values.

Current production engine input and output data use Kotlin `String` for GraphQL String, ID, and enum values. Qplan preserves that representation in `EngineInputData` and `EngineOutputData`. The result domain instead admits `String` only for GraphQL String, `EngineIDResult` for ID, and the canonical `ViaductSchema.EnumValue` owned by the expected enum type. Schema-directed publication converts output strings to those result representations, and resolver-input materialization converts them back to strings. `EngineIDData` and `EngineEnumValueData` are not part of the model.

`ViaductSchema.Enum` owns a collection of canonical `ViaductSchema.EnumValue` definitions and exposes nullable lookup through `value(name)`. Each enum value exposes its name and containing enum type; same-named values of different enum types are distinct. `EngineIDResult` is a structurally equal runtime value containing one string, not a canonical schema definition.

Input-object and argument field values use ordinary maps. Those maps belong to the input domain and do not extend the output domain. A fixture adapter for a looser external producer may materialize a map as `EngineObjectData.Sync` before crossing the qplan Engine API boundary, but no map may enter qplan as object output. Use `getValue` when presence is a precondition and test membership before an optional lookup so an absent entry remains distinct from a present null. EOD uses `isPresent` for passive presence tests and strict `get` when presence is a precondition.

Cells are allocated by their containing OER or LER and use reference identity as their occurrence ID. Object construction is immutable by default. Opt-in mutable objects atomically install each absent exact cell once and throw on unset reads, repeated claims, or repeated writes. Lists have immutable positions and may opt into mutable cell slots.

An exact result path contains only `ObjectEngineResult.ObjectKey` object steps and `ListEngineResult.Index` list steps. Object keys may contain occurrence-specific symbolic variables; abstract-field keys, schema fields, response keys, and aliases are not path components.

Response aliases and response ordering remain outside field-resolution identity. Canonical object fields plus ground arguments identify object cells; aliases belong to resolver-input materialization and must not create parallel OER or exact-path identities.

The fixture retains an unchanged GraphQL-Java source schema for validation and derives a separate canonical lowered `ViaductSchema` for reasoning. Source Node-valued fields are absent from the lowered schema: `foo: W<T>` is represented only by `foo_V_A_node: W<T_V_A_Bridge>`. Every Node object or interface has a matching object or interface bridge with ordinary `id` and `node` fields, and bridge possible-object relationships mirror the source implementation hierarchy. Runtime node references always materialize concrete object bridges. The `V_A` namespace is reserved for all lowered definitions, so source schema names containing `V_A` are rejected.

The lowered schema represents internal typename demand with ordinary active fields. `V_A_AllSourceObjects` is a synthetic interface owning `V_A_typename: String!` and containing every lowered source object in `possibleTypes`; every lowered source object and source interface owns its own argumentless `V_A_typename`, while unions and synthetic node bridges own no typename field. External operation translation erases source `__typename` recursively and preserves enclosing composite selections even when they become empty, leaving GraphQL Java to complete client typename fields from the concrete OER type. Internal resolver fragments lower source `__typename` to the owner field, to `V_A_AllSourceObjects.V_A_typename` in a union scope, and through the `node` payload for Node-valued source fields. Registry composition supplies one dependency-free constant resolver for every concrete `V_A_typename`. Resolver outputs and the root EOD contain no implicit typename selection.

Raw node references exist only as fixture inputs. Source-facing object construction and resolver adaptation lower them through `foo_V_A_node` producers and argumentless `T_V_A_Bridge.node` loaders before semantic reasoning. Resolver adaptation also recursively converts ordinary source-shaped object and list outputs into qplan-owned EODs. EOD stores only canonical lowered fields at that boundary.

Ordinary model and semantics tests use canonical `requireField` and `requireObjectField` coordinates, including explicit synthetic names for lowered Node and typename fields. Source-name translation is confined to explicit pre-reasoning boundaries: GraphQL parsing, source-facing object construction, source declaration compilation, resolver adaptation, arbitrary source-recipe materialization, and focused tests of those adapters. Canonical assertions and resolver oracles must not use source-name lookup. Fixture code exposes this translation through `SourceSchemaAdapter`, which requires the explicit source/lowered fixture pair.

## Engine API Boundary

Viaduct's `EngineObjectData.Sync` is the synchronous partial-object boundary. It is name-keyed and distinguishes absent selections from present-null values through `isPresent`. Qplan's validating implementation retains its canonical lowered `ViaductSchema.Object` while source-backed EODs expose the exact source GraphQL-Java object through the EOD interface. Tenant-visible materialization projects Node bridge producers and payloads back to source field and value shape. Fixture composition performs the inverse adaptation for tenant-produced EODs before semantic code uses the strict `schemaType` accessor.

Storage and access use that API where it preserves the modeled meaning, while explicit qplan structure retains schema-canonical keys, occurrence identity, write-once ownership, and access decisions that EOD does not represent directly. [`../handoff.md`](../handoff.md) records the resulting carrier state; this guide records its stable model rules.

The desired EOD contract distinguishes absent, present-null, present-success, and present-error selections without imposing Tenant API error policy. An absent selection makes `isPresent` false, makes `getOrNull` return null, and makes strict `get` throw production `UnsetFieldException`. A present selection whose value is null makes `isPresent` true and both getters return null. A present `EngineErrorData` selection remains present and its read returns that error carrier; presence and selection-enumeration operations must not materialize it or mistake it for an unset selection. The Tenant API layer decides whether exposing an erroneous field to tenant code throws. Current Engine API implementations instead throw during the EOD read; this is transitional compatibility behavior that should be removed. In the interim, qplan-owned EODs should use an explicit engine-only `outputValue` observation to recover the stored `EngineOutputData` without applying tenant-facing error policy. The `Sync` subtype's suspending operations follow the same boundary as their synchronous counterparts.

Missing OER cells are not unset EOD selections. They are internal result-tree lookup failures and use ordinary `NoSuchElementException`; they must not surface as tenant-facing `UnsetFieldException`.

## Working Vocabulary

A semantic category is a modeled set of values. It may be represented nominally by an interface hierarchy, such as `ViaductSchema.TypeDef`, or intensionally by a checked `Any` typealias, such as `EngineResult`.

A concrete variant is one particular form of value in a nominal category, such as `ViaductSchema.Object` within `ViaductSchema.TypeDef`. A semantic union member is one admitted representation in an intentional `Any`-represented domain, such as `EngineIDResult` within `EngineResult`.

A pre-domain type is an unambiguous runtime representation that may be admitted by one or more semantic domains. A pre-domain type does not inherit from or otherwise nominally belong to those domains. Kotlin primitives, `String`, `EngineIDResult`, and `ViaductSchema.EnumValue` are examples.

A logic-constructible type is a concrete semantic type that reasoning code is allowed to create through a model factory. `ObjectEngineResult`, `Promise`, `ObjectEngineResult.Key`, and `FieldResolver` are examples.

An externally supplied type is a semantic input that reasoning code may inspect but does not construct. `ViaductSchema` and `ResolverRegistry` are examples. An externally supplied registry may contain logic-constructible model values such as `FieldResolver`.

Pre-reasoning infrastructure is code that prepares externally supplied inputs before semantic reasoning begins. SDL decoding, GraphQL parsing, registry assembly, and private test-fixture implementations are examples.

An equality-free occurrence family is a finite collection of occurrences that supports traversal without comparing its payload values. `SelectionForest` is the motivating example because selection equality is undefined.

## Mathematical Function Signatures

Every function declared in the model main source set has a mathematical signature, regardless of its visibility or whether it is a member, extension, factory, or implementation helper. Each receiver, context parameter, ordinary parameter, and return value must denote an input or output of the modeled mathematical operation.

Do not add parameters or results solely for programming concerns such as improving an exception message, retaining a source path, labeling a call site, logging, tracing, formatting, debugging, or selecting an implementation strategy. In particular, recursive semantic functions must not thread diagnostic context that does not affect their mathematical result. A partial function may throw when its input is outside its domain; that exception is not a modeled output. Diagnostics may be derived from inputs already present in the mathematical signature, but otherwise use a less specific message or no message.

Keep functions requiring non-mathematical inputs or producing non-mathematical outputs in pre-reasoning infrastructure outside the model main source set.

## Public Type Forms

Public qplan-owned nominal semantic categories are sealed interfaces unless the category itself is intentionally supplied by external composition code. Externally supplied categories such as `ViaductSchema.TypeDef` and `ResolverRegistry` follow their owning libraries' extension rules. A performance-sensitive untyped union may instead be a documented `Any` typealias with explicit conformance operations.

Public qplan-owned leaf interfaces are also sealed unless their implementations are intentionally supplied by external composition code. For example, a logic-constructible `ObjectEngineResult` is sealed around its private implementation.

Public singleton semantic values are `data object` declarations only when the category truly has one semantic value. `CoercedDefaultValue.Absent` is an example. Metadata-bearing error carriers are not singleton semantic values.

Do not expose public data classes or public sealed classes. For example, expose `Promise` as a sealed interface backed by private implementations rather than exposing their generated component operations.

## Equality

Document equality at the highest semantic category that defines it. Subtypes inherit that contract unless the category explicitly assigns different equality modes to its variants.

Every public semantic category or variant has one of four equality modes: structural equality, reference equality, schema-canonical equality, or undefined equality.

Every semantic union additionally declares whether its member equality is homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous value-equality union permits equality across the complete union. A heterogeneous union has no union-wide equality relation: semantic code must first narrow values to a homogeneous subset. `EngineInputData` is homogeneous value-equality, including recursive list and input-object structure. `EngineOutputData` is heterogeneous and has undefined union-wide equality; its `EngineSimpleData` subset is homogeneous value-equality and may be compared after schema-directed narrowing. Qplan-owned EOD and `EngineErrorData` members use reference equality when host-language equality is unavoidable, but semantic logic must not compare, hash, deduplicate, or key collections by arbitrary `EngineOutputData`. `EngineResult` is likewise heterogeneous; use variant-specific equality or `sameCompletedResultAs` rather than whole-union equality.

Structural equality means that two values are equal exactly when they have the same semantic constructor and their corresponding components are recursively equal. For example, two object keys are equal when their fields and argument values are equal, while a named type expression is never equal to a list type expression.

`Arguments` has structural equality before and after grounding. Open argument expressions compare variables by their defining field, local name, and variable-instance ID at the exact recursive list or input-object position where each variable appears. Completing a variable binding does not affect argument equality or hashing. Two argument tuples containing distinct variable instances therefore remain unequal even when those variables later bind to equal input values.

Reference equality means that two values are equal exactly when they are the same runtime occurrence. `EngineResultCell` and `ObjectEngineResult` use reference equality because their promise state is monotonically mutable. Their identity hashes are stable while cells or promises are installed and completed, so either may be used safely as a map key. A cell is allocated by its containing OER or LER, and its reference identity is its occurrence ID. `ListEngineResult` remains structural over its type expression and positional cell identity. Use `sameCompletedResultAs` when an explicit extensional comparison of completed result graphs is required; it compares symbolic variable occurrences by root-relative address, validates corresponding parent backedges by ancestor identity without recursively following them, and thereby keeps equivalent independently rooted executions comparable without weakening ordinary root-qualified identity.

Schema-canonical equality applies only to the canonical `ViaductSchema` and its definition graph elements, including `TypeDef`, `EnumValue`, `Field`, and `FieldArg`. Two schema elements are compared only when they belong to the same canonical lowered schema. Applying `==` to elements from different schemas is outside the modeled equality domain, regardless of the host-language result.

Undefined equality means that Kotlin `==`, `equals`, hashing, membership in equality-based collections, map-key use, deduplication, and other equality-dependent operations have no semantic interpretation for that category. `Selection`, resolver values, resolver functions, and `Assumptions` are examples.

Semantic logic must not apply equality-dependent operations to undefined-equality values. For example, key a resolver-demand graph by canonical `ViaductSchema.ObjectField` elements rather than resolver objects, and represent selections with an equality-free occurrence family rather than a `Multiset<Selection>`.

`SelectionForest` supports current-member count, emptiness, permutation-invariant traversal, filtering, transformation, and concatenation. The one-member-per-source-field property belongs specifically to the corresponding forests returned by GraphQL selection flattening; it is not a carrier invariant. No operation internally compares whole `Selection` values. `merge(type)` filters and specializes occurrences to one concrete parent type, coalesces ordinary-equal open `ObjectKey` values, and returns an `ObjectSelectionForest`. `ObjectSelectionForest.instantiateBindings()` is the separate grounding boundary: it throws unless every current argument expression can be grounded and coalesces keys that become equal after substitution. Checked ground-key views are required before exact OER operations. Neither forest exposes selection membership, equality-based selection counting, hashing, forest equality, or observable ordering.

`MaterializeSelection` is a separate undefined-equality source-occurrence category. It retains one GraphQL response key alongside the same canonical key, applicability guard, and recursive shape needed for construction. `MaterializeSelectionForest` is its equality-free occurrence family. `constructionSelections()` recursively erases only response keys and is the one ordinary `SelectionForest` view of those occurrences.

Concrete field collection is explicit. `MaterializeSelectionForest.collect(type)` first filters source occurrences by the concrete parent object type, then groups solely by response key. Co-applicable members of one group must have equal concrete fields and syntactically equal open arguments before variable binding. Their nested source occurrences are concatenated without premature child collection. Mutually exclusive alternatives may therefore retain different source field invocations under one response key, while `ObjectMaterializeSelection` represents the one group selected for a concrete parent. Distinct response keys may share one ordinary variable-free construction key.

`ObjectEngineResult.ObjectKey` is the exact OER-cell and object-path key category. Its arguments may be symbolic when every variable is an immutable occurrence-specific instance. `ObjectEngineResult.GroundKey` remains the resolved-argument refinement used at boundaries that need concrete input values. OER key hashing never depends on the eventual values bound to symbolic variables.

An object key is **contextually grounded** under one `Assumptions` value when every variable in its arguments is occurrence-specific and has a completed binding in that world, so its arguments can be grounded without replacing the key by that grounded projection. Variable-free keys satisfy the predicate vacuously. OER storage and exact paths do not require or receive an assumptions context; world-aware operations should require contextual grounding when they need the key's symbolic variables to denote available values.

The test-fixture `Fragment` carrier retains a nominal composite type and an unnormalized forest for parsed selection requirements and pre-reasoning transformations. It is not part of the production model artifact. Canonical field-resolver `objectFragment` values are open `SelectionForest`s whose top-level occurrences have been specialized to the resolver field's concrete containing type.

Prefer a private data-class implementation when its generated structural equality exactly matches the category's equality contract. `IntValueImpl`, `KeyImpl`, and `GroundKeyImpl` are representative examples. Use a private regular implementation for an undefined-equality category such as `SelectionImpl`, or whenever generated componentwise equality is otherwise not the category's modeled equality.

## Construction

Distinguish logic-constructible types from externally supplied types. OERs, runtime values, and model-owned field-resolver wrappers are logic-constructible; `ViaductSchema` and `ResolverRegistry` are externally supplied. Field-resolver functions are supplied during pre-reasoning assembly and encapsulated by `FieldResolver` behind model-owned factories and the public demand-bearing invocation operation. `FieldResolver.of` accepts a `NonselectiveFieldResolverFunction` and adapts it to the canonical selective relation by projecting its stable output in selective worlds; `FieldResolver.ofSelective` accepts a `SelectiveFieldResolverFunction` directly and performs no post-invocation projection. For fixed non-selection inputs, a selective function has the same null, error, simple, list, and concrete-object skeleton across demands and agrees on every object-field coordinate selected by two demands; only object-field coverage may vary with demand. External raw node lookups, when accepted by composition infrastructure, are lowered to field resolvers before the canonical registry is exposed.

Every independently constructible non-singleton semantic type has a public factory, conventionally named `of`. For example, `ObjectEngineResult`, `EngineIDResult`, `EngineErrorData`, `ErrorEngineResult`, `Promise`, and `FieldResolver` have factories. `EngineResultCell` is deliberately not independently constructible: OER and LER factories allocate their cells so a cell cannot be shared by two containers. Pre-domain Kotlin values and abstract semantic domains need no domain-wide factory.

Logic-constructible types use private `FooImpl` classes by preference, such as `KeyImpl` implementing `ObjectEngineResult.Key` and `GroundKeyImpl` implementing `ObjectEngineResult.GroundKey`. Use an internal `FooImpl` only when cross-file implementation access is necessary. Anonymous implementations are not used.

Externally supplied types have no qplan model construction factory or main-source implementation. Fixture composition obtains definitions from the canonical lowered `ViaductSchema` and privately implements `ResolverRegistry`; semantic code sees only those public interfaces.

Keep schema decoding, GraphQL parsing, resolver-function definitions, registry assembly, dependency-injection modules, and other pre-reasoning composition outside production semantic source sets. The model-owned resolver wrappers are the boundary that hides those functions from semantic algorithms. Tests that need a complete reasoning world construct it through `model.testing.TestWorld`; ordinary test sources do not decode schemas or assemble registries directly.

Constructors are private where possible and otherwise internal. Internal model code may call an internal constructor directly, but factory use remains preferred.

Factories return the most precise public type available. For example, a factory that always creates `CoercedDefaultValue.Present` returns `Present`, not the broader `CoercedDefaultValue`.

Place a factory on the highest semantic category where its meaning remains coherent and Kotlin overload resolution remains unambiguous. For example, `CoercedDefaultValue.of(value)` belongs on `CoercedDefaultValue`, while resolved argument construction belongs on `Arguments.Resolved`. Prefer overloads that select precise variants when their parameter types are unambiguous.

An `of` factory normally accepts already semantic components. For example, `Promise.of` accepts the semantic value it immediately contains. Parsing GraphQL text and decoding SDL are pre-reasoning infrastructure rather than `of` factory behavior.

GraphQL coercion may be a semantic function. For example, construction of an argument-bearing object key may apply argument coercion, but the coercion relation should be independently defined rather than embedded only inside `ObjectEngineResult.Key.of`. Each coercion function separately specifies whether coercion failure is a modeled result or an input outside its domain.

Factories establish all carrier invariants available at their construction boundary eagerly and document those postconditions on the factory. Reusable invariant relations live in `model.invariants`. For example, `ObjectEngineResult.of` validates every initially present value coordinate, nullability, and nested result type, while `EngineResultCell` setters and validating deferred promises enforce the value-slot and access-result relations before completion. Every observable completed value therefore satisfies its documented carrier invariants, and `correctResolution` does not need schema conformance as a separate conjunct.

Use compositional validation for nested typed values. For example, a list factory validates its elements, and an enclosing OER factory checks that the list's declared element type is compatible with the field type rather than traversing and revalidating the entire list.

## Type Expressions

Schema definitions use `ViaductSchema.TypeExpr` directly. Its flat wrapper data is traversed with `isList`, `listDepth`, `nullableAtDepth`, `baseTypeNullable`, `unwrapList`, and `unwrapLists`; qplan does not reconstruct a recursive type-expression hierarchy. Qplan-owned result containers retain the explicit `typeExpr` name, such as `ListEngineResult.typeExpr`, while properties containing named schema definitions normally remain `type`, such as `ObjectEngineResult.type`. EOD's production API uses `type` for its `GraphQLObjectType`; qplan's implementation separately retains the canonical `ViaductSchema.Object`, exposed through the context-free `schemaType` extension.
