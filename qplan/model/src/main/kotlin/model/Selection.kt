 *   selection may also have no subselections.
 * - A selection's [key] is a [ObjectEngineResult.ObjectKey] exactly when it is an [ObjectSelection].
 *
 * ### Invariant: selection-well-foundedness
 *
 * A selection and its [subselections] form a finite, well-founded value.

 * ### Equality
 *
 * Kotlin `equals` is currently undefined for [Selection]. The model does not yet assume that
 * selections can or need to be compared; proofs must not rely on selection equality until that

     * ### Representation
     *
     * [ObjectEngineResult.Key.field] is the canonical schema field intended by this selection, and
     * its containing type records the immediate field-lookup context. Non-variable argument values
     * are in their coerced semantic form. An argument may contain a [Arguments.Variable]. Variables
     * compare by name. Because a selection key is outside an OER or [EngineObjectData.Sync], its field may
     * belong to an abstract [ViaductSchema.Interface] or [ViaductSchema.Union], and its arguments may
     * contain variables. Before a key is present in either value, its field must belong to the
     * applicable concrete [ViaductSchema.Object] and its variables must be instantiated.

     * Because of GraphQL's validation rules for type conditions, the relationship between the
