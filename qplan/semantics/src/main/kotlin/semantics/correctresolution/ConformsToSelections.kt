/**
 * Whether this result contains every value required by [selections].
 *
 * At every object occurrence, selections are normalized against the runtime concrete object type
 * and current variable bindings before lookup. Null and error values stop recursive requirements.
 * Values not required by [selections] are permitted.
 *
 * This predicate trusts the selections' post-validation schema compatibility and the engine-result
 * carrier invariants established by its factories. It observes values, but not field or type
 * checks.
 *
 * This operation is defined only when applicable selection keys contain no unbound variables.
