/**
 * Whether this primary Query-rooted result is a correct field-resolution result for [selections].
 *
 * The judgment is plan-independent and does not observe access-acceptance results. Also,
 * this judgment is purposefully permissive: as long as the [ObjectEngineResult] conforms
 * to our world assumptions (e.g., regarding schema conformance and resolver conformance),
 * this predicate allows the [ObjectEngineResult] to contain more values than the input
 * [selections] and implicated [model.registry.FieldResolver.objectFragment]s require. Other
 * predicates define various degrees of minimality.
 *
 * [selections] must be rooted at the reasoning world's canonical Query type. Reapplying a resolver
 * with a nonempty query fragment also requires the independently resolved Query OER retained in
 * the resolver observations for that exact resolver occurrence to be a correct resolution.
 * Each judged result gets one replay cache shared by demand and conformance checks. Nested Query
 * results get their own caches but retain the same reference witness across the whole judgment.
 * Neither the cache nor the witness is retained by [operation] across separate judgments.
 *
 * This is math, not programming: the Kotlin application syntax here expresses the
 * modeled function relation, not programming-language procedure executions.  These should
 * be reasoned about as inductively-defined relations, not recursive routines.
