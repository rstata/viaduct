 * Every [create] call returns a fresh dispatcher. The caller chooses the lifetime, reuses the
 * dispatcher across the resolutions in that lifetime, and closes it afterward. The factory does
 * not retain dispatchers, read configuration, or own request lifecycles.
 *
 * Worker threads are daemon threads named `resolver26-N-M`: `N` is a process-local pool
 * identifier and `M` is that pool's thread identifier. Neither number is the configured thread
 * count. The names group thread-dump entries by pool and support profiler filtering and per-thread
 * CPU sampling; they are diagnostic labels and do not record observations or measurements.
