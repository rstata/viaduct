/**
 * Materializes a Resolver01-23 runtime object or declared Query-fragment input.
 *
 * Delegates to [materializeResult]: selected cells and value promises must be installed, while
 * values and selection bindings may still be pending. The caller's [operation] and [cycleChecker]
 * are passed through unchanged. The checker is required here even though result projection
 * defaults to no-op checking.
 *
 * Resolver26 uses its distinct runtime input materializer to reserve symbolic cells and value
 * promises before their producers install them. Correctness replay, including replay of
 * Resolver26 inputs, and nested `ctx.query` results use [materializeResult] directly.
