-------------------------- MODULE Resolver01 --------------------------
EXTENDS ResolverCoreProof

(*
Resolver01 is scoped here to the stage requested for this proof: resolver
object fragments are empty. The Kotlin implementation is more general because
fixture-lowered node loaders may have direct synthetic-bridge requirements;
that larger local-demand case is covered by Resolver02.
